# Instructions — build the property "summary" HTML

Reusable spec for (re)generating `property_summary.html`: a single, self-contained, printable page that ranks every evaluated property. Follow this whenever `property_data.json` changes or a fresh summary is requested.

## Goal

One standalone `.html` file (opens in any browser, no server, no external assets) showing all properties ranked by weighted score, with a full detail table + top-3 cards + a methodology footer. Save it to the project folder as `property_summary.html`.

## Data source

Read from `property_data.json` (the single source of truth). Each property object uses these fields:

- `address` (string, "Street nr, City") · `url` (Funda link ONLY)
- `price` (€, int) · `area` (m², int or null) · `bedrooms` (int)
- `woz` (€ or null) · `build_year` (int) · `energy_label` ("A"–"G")
- `ground` (free-text NL string, e.g. "Eigen grond" / "Erfpacht afgekocht" / "Erfpacht lopend" / "Erfpacht (status onbekend)" | null) — **every distinct value must have a matching key in `GROUND_RU` in `build.js`** (see "Keep in sync")
- `vve_costs` (€/mo or null) · `*_estimated` flags (bool) where a value is an estimate
- `dist_emmakade_min`, `dist_zuidas_min` (bike minutes, int) — feed the `location` score
- `outdoor_space` (string or absent) — canonical token + optional size, e.g. `"balcony ~7 m²"`, `"terrace (west)"`, `"garden ~15 m²"`. Token must be one of `none | shared | balcony | loggia | terrace | roof terrace | garden` and **have a matching key in `OUTDOOR_RU` in `build.js`** (same discipline as `GROUND_RU`). Omit the field when the listing gives no outdoor info — the `outdoor` score is then left unscored and renormalises (don't guess).
- `scores`: `{ value, condition, legal }` each 1–10 (hand-scored). All other criteria (`family, location, energy, tenure, costs, outdoor`) are **computed by `build.js`** — see "Scoring model v3". Optional model fields: `age_restricted`, `family_adj` (+`family_adj_reason`), `location_adj`, `energy_upgrade`, `heating_advance`.
- `sale_history` (array, optional): structured prior transactions/relistings — `[{ date:"YYYY-MM[-DD]", price:int|null, event, src }]`, `event ∈ purchase | listed | relisted | withdrawn | under_offer | sold | price_change`. Rendered in the "Sales history & comparable prices" appendix; `purchase`/`sold` entries also drive the top-3 "Prior sale" line. Migrate from `notes` rather than leaving sale data only in prose.
- `comps` (array, optional): comparable sold/asking units — `[{ address, price:int, date, area:int|null, kind:"sold"|"asking", note }]`. Rendered in the appendix + top-3 cards.
- `notes` (string) · optional `heritage` (string) · `date_found`, `source`
- `sources` (object, optional) — per-field provenance; now **read by `build.js`** to compute verification confidence (see "Verification confidence & triggers").

## Scoring model v3 (must match the artifact and the agents)

Weighted total out of 10, tuned for the buyer's real brief: a **live-in home for one adult + a 3-yo (shared custody), to be sold in 5–10 years**. Two clusters — livability ~53%, financial/resale ~47%.

**v3 key change (2026-06-09): six criteria are COMPUTED by `build.js` from measured fields — do not hand-score them.** Only `value`, `condition` and `legal` are hand-scored in `scores`. A hand value on a computed key acts as an override and triggers an `OVERRIDE` build warning — use only with a documented reason.

| Criterion | key | weight | cluster | How it's scored (1–10) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Family fit & space | `family` | 18% | living | **Computed.** 55+/ballotage (`age_restricted: true`) → 1. Studio → 2 · 1 bed → 3 · 2 bed: <55 m² → 4, 55–64 → 6, 65–74 → 7, 75–84 → 8, ≥85 → 9 · 3+ bed: <70 → 8, 70–84 → 9, ≥85 → 10. Plus optional `family_adj` (± int, with `family_adj_reason`) for documented potential, e.g. attic = +1, "2nd bedroom must be created" = −2. |
| Value at entry | `value` | 16% | financial | **Manual.** From asking-vs-WOZ premium + €/m² vs local comps. ≤WOZ & cheap €/m² → 9–10; +5–10% → 6; +18–28% → 4; >28% or overpriced-for-condition → 3. Temper for low-ask bidding-war listings. |
| Location & commute | `location` | 15% | living | **Computed.** Emmakade: ≤7 min → 10, then −0.6/min (floor 2); Zuidas: ≤6 min → 10, then −0.5/min (floor 2); blend 60/40. Plus `location_adj` ∈ {−1, +1} for neighbourhood (quiet/green +1, busy arterial −1). |
| Condition / move-in ready | `condition` | 14% | living | **Manual.** Fully renovated/move-in → 9; modernised → 7–8; dated → 4–5; full gut needed → 2–3. |
| Energy label | `energy` | 10% | financial | **Computed.** A=10 · B=9 · C=7 · D=5 · E=4 · F=3 · G=2; **−1 if the label is estimated/conflicted** (per `fieldState`); **+1 if `energy_upgrade: "easy"`, +0.5 if `"moderate"`** (the brief's "label improvable easily = a plus"). easy = ≥2 classes reachable with glazing/boiler only, under individual control; moderate = reachable with envelope work you control; omit when blokverwarming / VvE-dependent facade. |
| Tenure / erfpacht | `tenure` | 8% | financial | **Computed** from the exact `ground` string via `TENURE_SCORE` in `build.js` (eigen grond 10 · eeuwigdurend afgekocht 9 · eigen grond unverified 8 · afgekocht fixed-term 7 · vastgeklikt/afkoop aangevraagd 5 · lopend/tijdvak 4 · erfpacht te verifieren/onbekend 3). **Every distinct `ground` value needs a `TENURE_SCORE` entry** (same discipline as `GROUND_RU`); unmapped → `TENURE-UNMAPPED` warning + renormalise. Null ground → unscored. |
| Running costs | `costs` | 8% | financial | **Computed** from all-in monthly = `vve_costs` + `heating_advance` (optional field for a known separate heating/stookkosten advance): ≤100 → 10 · ≤150 → 9 · ≤200 → 8 · ≤250 → 7 · ≤300 → 6 · ≤360 → 5 · ≤450 → 4 · >450 → 3. Null `vve_costs` → unscored. |
| Outdoor space | `outdoor` | 6% | living | **Computed** from the `outdoor_space` token: garden 9 · roof terrace 8 · terrace 7 · balcony 5 (+1 if ≥5 m², +1 if south/west; cap 7) · loggia 5 · shared 3 · none 2. Omit (renormalise) if unknown. |
| Legal / title risk | `legal` | 5% | financial | **Manual.** Residual **non-erfpacht** risk only. Start ~8; deduct for VvE problems, disclosure conflicts, missing splitsingsakte, heritage limits, structural/pile risk, ex-rental clauses. (55+/ballotage is handled by `family` = 1.) |

Livability = 18+15+14+6 = 53%; financial = 16+10+8+8+5 = 47%.

`total = Σ(score × weight) / Σ(weight of scored criteria)` — i.e. blank criteria (e.g. unknown `outdoor`/`tenure`/`costs`) renormalise over the ones that are scored. Round to 2 decimals for display. Sort descending.

Per-property model fields (all optional unless noted): `scores: { value, condition, legal }` (required trio), `age_restricted` (bool), `family_adj` + `family_adj_reason`, `location_adj` (−1/+1), `energy_upgrade` ("easy"|"moderate"), `heating_advance` (€/mo).

## Layout (top to bottom)

1. **Header**: title "Dream House — Property Summary"; subtitle line (segment list: "Amstelveen + Amsterdam Buitenveldert · all sizes · verified vs official Funda + a second source · <count> properties"). No bedroom limit.
2. **Weights legend**: the eight criteria with their percentages, plus a one-line cluster note (livability ~55% / financial ~45%).
3. **Detail table** (interactive; one `<tbody class="prop">` per property — a main row + a hidden detail row — sorted by score), columns:
   `# · Address (Funda link) · Score (colored pill) · Conf. · Viewing (badge) · Price · €/m² · WOZ · m² · Beds · Built · Label (colored, ↑ = upgrade potential) · Ground · Outdoor · €/mo (all-in, * = incl. heating advance) · Bike→Emma · Bike→Zuidas · Notes (3-line clamp)`

   Interactivity (vanilla inline JS, still a single self-contained file):
   - **Toolbar**: address search, city chips (All / Amstelveen / Amsterdam), min-beds, max-price, visited-only checkbox, reset, live "showing N of M" counter. Filters hide whole `<tbody>` groups and renumber the # column.
   - **Sortable headers** (`th.s[data-k]`): click toggles asc/desc on the matching `data-*` attribute; numeric by default, `data-t="s"` = string, `data-a="1"` = ascending-first (label, costs, distances).
   - **Row click** (not on links) toggles the detail row: per-criterion **score breakdown** (bar + weight + computed inputs: beds/m², bike minutes ± adj, label ± modifiers, ground string, €/mo all-in, outdoor token), full notes, sale-history timeline + comps, and the per-field `sources` list with status chips.
   - Sticky `thead` inside a max-height scroll container; `@media print` hides the toolbar and detail rows.

   Viewing badge: value is "No" (muted), "Scheduled YYYY-MM-DD" (amber), or "Visited YYYY-MM-DD" (green). WOZ cell also shows the asking-vs-WOZ premium (e.g. "+43% ask", green if ≤0). Outdoor cell shows `outdoor_space` ("?" when absent), RU-translated via `OUTDOOR_RU`.
4. **Top-3 detail cards**: the three highest scores, each with price, €/m², area, beds, label, ground, outdoor, bike times, plus a compact score-breakdown bar list. Highlight rank 1 (2px border).
5. **Footer**: one paragraph on methodology + the estimate caveat.

## Visual conventions

- Self-contained: inline CSS, no external fonts/scripts. Light mode (`color-scheme: light`), white surfaces, 1px `#e6e9ef` borders, radius 12px cards.
- **Score pill color** (by total): `≥7.5` green `#15803d` · `≥6.5` blue `#2563eb` · `≥5.5` amber `#d97706` · `<5.5` red `#dc2626`.
- **Energy label color**: A `#15803d` · B `#65a30d` · C `#84a017` · D `#d97706` · E `#ea7317` · F `#dc2626` · G `#b91c1c`.
- **€/m²** = `round(price / area)`; show "—" when area is null.
- **VvE cell**: prefix `~` when estimated, show `n/a` for houses (no VvE), `?` when unknown.
- Numbers formatted `nl-NL` (e.g. €485.000). Round every displayed number.
- Highlight `FLAG`/`FLAGS`/`CONFLICT`/`CORRECTED` words in notes (e.g. amber/red emphasis).
- **Links: Funda only.** Use the property's official Funda detail URL; fall back to a Funda street-search URL only if no detail page is known.

## Build steps

1. Read `property_data.json`; embed the records inline in a `<script>` `DATA = [...]` array (so the file is fully self-contained), OR fetch-and-render if kept dynamic. Embedding is preferred for a portable file.
2. Compute totals with the weights above; sort descending; render table + cards + footer.
3. Mark estimated fields (`~`, "est", "verify") from the `*_estimated` flags / notes.
4. Save to `/property_summary.html` in the project folder.

## Verification (always do before finishing)

- JSON parses; row count matches `property_data.json`.
- Each row's displayed `total` equals the recomputed weighted score (diff < 0.001).
- No `€/m²` outliers slip through unexplained (sanity-check < €3,000 or > €8,000).
- Every `url` is on `funda.nl` (no other domains).
- Confirm the file renders, then present it to the user with the file-sharing tool.

## Keep in sync — use `build.js`

`property_data.json` is the single source of truth. **Do not hand-edit the HTML** — run the build script:

```
node build.js            # regenerates property_summary.html + property_summary_ru.html,
                         # and stamps index.html footer with an incrementing build # + today's date
BUILD_DATE=2026-06-05 node build.js   # override the "Generated" date
```

`build.js` defines the weight model in ONE place and recomputes every total, so `property_summary.html` and `property_summary_ru.html` can no longer drift. Edit `property_data.json`, then rebuild.

**Ground lease (RU):** the `ground` field is free-text Dutch, and the RU summary translates it via the `GROUND_RU` map in `build.js`. Whenever you add a property — or edit a property's `ground` — with a Dutch value not already a key in `GROUND_RU`, **add its Russian translation to `GROUND_RU` in the same change**. `build.js` logs `ground not translated for RU` for any unmapped value; treat that warning as a build failure to fix, not a value to leave as untranslated Dutch in the RU output. (Same discipline as `notes_ru` below.)

**Outdoor space (RU):** `outdoor_space` uses a canonical English token (`none | shared | balcony | loggia | terrace | roof terrace | garden`) optionally followed by a size/side (e.g. `"balcony ~7 m²"`). The RU summary translates the leading token via the `OUTDOOR_RU` map. Any new token must get an `OUTDOOR_RU` entry in the same change — `build.js` logs `outdoor_space token not translated for RU`; treat as a build failure.

**Scores (per property):** when adding/editing a property, hand-score only `value`, `condition`, `legal` per the rubric — `build.js` computes `family`, `location`, `energy`, `tenure`, `costs`, `outdoor` from the data fields. `build.js` logs `missing manual scores [...]` for a missing required key, `OVERRIDE` when a hand value shadows a computed criterion, `TENURE-UNMAPPED` for a `ground` string missing from `TENURE_SCORE`, and `VISITED-NO-OUTDOOR` when a visited property still has no `outdoor_space` — treat the first three as build failures to fix, the last as a viewing-checklist item.

**Russian summary:** each property carries a `notes_ru` field (plain Russian text). `build.js` renders the RU summary from `notes_ru`, applying the same flag highlighting to the Russian tokens `ПРОВЕРЕНО · ИСПРАВЛЕНО · РАСХОЖДЕНИЕ · КОНФЛИКТ · ФЛАГ · РИСК`. If a new property has no `notes_ru`, the RU summary falls back to the English `notes` and `build.js` logs which are missing — so add a `notes_ru` alongside `notes` for every new entry.

### Optional `sources` provenance block

Each property may carry an additive `sources` object documenting where each field was verified (back-compatible; the renderer ignores unknown keys):

```json
"sources": {
  "energy_label": { "value": "A", "src": "EP-Online", "url": "https://ep-online.nl", "checked": "2026-05-31", "status": "verified" }
}
```

`status` ∈ `verified | corrected | unconfirmed | conflict`. Authoritative public registers: **BAG** (bagviewer.kadaster.nl — area + build year), **EP-Online** (ep-online.nl — energy label), **WOZ-waardeloket** (wozwaardeloket.nl — WOZ), **Kadaster**/Amsterdam erfpacht map (ground lease), **Kadaster koopsom** (transaction history → `sale_history`). Note: Funda and most registers are bot-/JS-gated, so automated scraping is unreliable — treat aggregator (kadasterdata/huispedia) figures as a second opinion that can show stale or building-level data, and confirm against the authoritative register before relying on a value.

## Verification confidence & triggers

`build.js` reads the `sources` block + `*_estimated`/`*_verified` flags to score each property's **data confidence** over six decision-critical `KEY_FIELDS` = `price, area, woz, energy_label, ground, bedrooms`. Per field, `fieldState()` resolves to `verified` (source `status: verified`/`corrected`, or a `*_verified:true` flag), `conflict` (`status: conflict`), `estimated` (`status: unconfirmed` or `*_estimated:true`), `unknown` (value null), else `assumed` (a value with **no** independent source — e.g. taken from the listing only; counts as *not* verified). The summary shows a **`Conf.` pill** `✓N/6` (green ≥5 · amber ≥3 · red <3; `⚠` on any conflict; hover for the unverified fields).

**Tiered verification policy** — rigor scales with how serious a property is; `build.js` warns when a tier's expectations aren't met:

| Tier | Trigger | Verify (independent source) | build.js warning |
|---|---|---|---|
| **0 — Intake** | every property added | Funda listing; WOZ (WOZ-waardeloket); EP-Online if a label is registered | — |
| **1 — Shortlist** | viewing scheduled/visited, or a high score | BAG area; EP-Online label; **Amsterdam erfpacht** register (ground/tenure); Kadaster *koopsom* (→ `sale_history`); 2–3 `comps` | `TIER-1 …: unverified ground, area, energy_label` for any viewed/scheduled property whose those fields aren't `verified` |
| **2 — Pre-offer** | offer contemplated | full seller-document due diligence (the 18-doc set: vragenlijst, akte, splitsingsakte, MJOP, VvE notulen/balans, NEN2580, energielabel, opstalpolis, funderingsattest…) | — |

Other verification warnings `build.js` emits: `CONFLICT …` (any field `status: conflict`), `STALE …` (a source `checked` > 180 days before the build date), `STALE-WOZ …` (WOZ `peildatum` older than its own history), `LOW-CONF #n …` (a top-10 property with < 50% of key fields verified). Treat these as a worklist of what to fetch next — they do **not** fail the build.
